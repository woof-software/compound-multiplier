# High Issues

## H-1: Yul block contains `return` function call.

Remove this, as this causes execution to halt. Nothing after that call will execute, including code following the assembly block.

## H-2: Delegatecall made by the function without checks on any adress.

Introduce checks on the address

  ```solidity

  ```

</details>

## H-3: Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function.

It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.

# Low Issues

## L-1: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.

  ```solidity
              Math.mulDiv(collateralAmount, price, 10 ** AggregatorV3Interface(info.priceFeed).decimals()),
  ```

- Found in contracts/CometMultiplierAdapter.sol [Line: 453](contracts/CometMultiplierAdapter.sol#L453)

  ```solidity
          return 10 ** AggregatorV3Interface(priceFeed).decimals() * scale;
  ```

</details>

## L-2: Large literal values multiples of 10000 can be replaced with scientific notation

Use `e` notation, for example: `1e18`, instead of its full numeric value.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>

- Found in contracts/CometCollateralSwap.sol [Line: 67](contracts/CometCollateralSwap.sol#L67)

  ```solidity
      uint16 public constant BPS_DROP_DENOMINATOR = 10_000;

- Found in contracts/CometMultiplierAdapter.sol [Line: 31](contracts/CometMultiplierAdapter.sol#L31)

  ```solidity
  uint256 constant LEVERAGE_PRECISION = 10_000;
  ```

</details>

## L-3: Loop contains `require`/`revert` statements

Avoid `require` / `revert` statements in a loop because a single bad item can cause the whole transaction to fail. It's better to forgive on fail and return failed elements post processing of the loop
