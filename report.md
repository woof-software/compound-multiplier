# High Issues

## H-1: Yul block contains `return` function call.

Remove this, as this causes execution to halt. Nothing after that call will execute, including code following the assembly block.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>

- Found in contracts/CometFoundation.sol [Line: 120](contracts/CometFoundation.sol#L120)

  ```solidity
              return(0x00, 0x20)
  ```

</details>

## H-2: Sending native Eth is not protected from these functions.

Introduce checks for `msg.sender` in the function

  ```solidity
      fallback() external payable {
  ```

  ```solidity
      function rescue(IERC20 token) external {
  ```

</details>

## H-3: Contract locks Ether without a withdraw function.

It appears that the contract includes a payable function to accept Ether but lacks a corresponding function to withdraw it, which leads to the Ether being locked in the contract. To resolve this issue, please implement a public or external function that allows for the withdrawal of Ether from the contract.

# Low Issues

## L-1: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

- Found in contracts/CometFoundation.sol [Line: 560](contracts/CometFoundation.sol#L560)

  ```solidity
              payable(user).transfer(amount);
  ```

</details>

## L-2: Define and use `constant` variables instead of using literals

If the same constant literal value is used multiple times, create a constant state variable and reference it throughout the contract.
